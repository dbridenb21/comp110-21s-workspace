<h2 class="subheading"> Irrefutable proof as to why Carolina blue is the superior color</h2>
<p>This statement is supported by nature, in particular the sky. 
    Looking outside on a warm day, you would expect the sky to 
    be a nice, light blue. If you look outside and the sky is dark 
    blue, then you might be in the stratosphere. Not where you 
    want to be (just like a Duke game), case closed.</p>
